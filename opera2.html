  <h4  class="DUCK">DUCK</h4>  <p3 class="song"> From the sunny Spanish shore,
            The Duke of Plaza-Tor!—

            DUET—MARCO and GIUSEPPE.

            We're called gondolieri,
            But that's a vagary,
            It's quite honorary
                 The trade that we ply.
            For gallantry noted
            Since we were short-coated,
            To beauty devoted,
                 Giuseppe\Are Marco and I;

            When morning is breaking,
            Our couches forsaking,
            To greet their awaking
                 With carols we come.
            At summer day's nooning,
            When weary lagooning,
            Our mandolins tuning,
                 We lazily thrum.

            When vespers are ringing,
            To hope ever clinging,
            With songs of our singing
                 A vigil we keep,
            When daylight is fading,
            Enwrapt in night's shading,
            With soft serenading
                 We sing them to sleep.
