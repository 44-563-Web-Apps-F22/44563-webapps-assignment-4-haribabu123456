    <h3>The Gondoliers</h3>
    <p class="directions">CHORUS OF MEN with MARCO and GIUSEPPE-Pavilion in the Court of Barataria.  Marco and
        Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,
        occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre.  The Gondoliers
        are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank,
        etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various
        degrees.  All are enjoying themselves without reference to social
        distinctions—some playing cards, others throwing dice, some
        reading, others playing cup and ball, "morra", etc</h5>

                 But without your society
            Existence was slow,
                 And we wanted variety—</p>

 

<h4 class="ALL" >ALL.</h4>     <p class="speech"> So here we are, at the risk of our lives,
       From ever so far, and we've brought your wives—
       And to that end we've crossed the main,
       And don't intend to return again!</p>

     <p>  Dance a cachucha, fandango, bolero,
       Xeres we'll drink—Manzanilla, Montero—
       Wine, when it runs in abundance, enhances
       The reckless delight of that wildest of dances!
            To the pretty pitter-pitter-patter,
            And the clitter-clitter-clitter-clatter—
                 Clitter—clitter—clatter,
                 Pitter—pitter—patter,
            Patter, patter, patter, patter, we'll dance.
       Old Xeres we'll drink—Manzanilla, Montero;
       For wine, when it runs in abundance, enhances
       The reckless delight of that wildest of dances!</p>
