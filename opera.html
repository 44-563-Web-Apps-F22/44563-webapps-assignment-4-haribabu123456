    <h3>The Gondoliers</h3>
    <h5>CHORUS OF MEN with MARCO and GIUSEPPE-Pavilion in the Court of Barataria.  Marco and
        Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,
        occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre.  The Gondoliers
        are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank,
        etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various
        degrees.  All are enjoying themselves without reference to social
        distinctions—some playing cards, others throwing dice, some
        reading, others playing cup and ball, "morra", etc</h5>
        <p>
            Take a pair of sparkling eyes,
                 Hidden, ever and anon,
                      In a merciful eclipse—
            Do not heed their mild surprise—
                 Having passed the Rubicon,
                      Take a pair of rosy lips;
            Take a figure trimly planned—
                 Such as admiration whets—
                      (Be particular in this);
            Take a tender little hand,
                 Fringed with dainty fingerettes,
                      Press it—in parenthesis;—
            Ah! Take all these, you lucky man—
            Take and keep them, if you can!

            Take a pretty little cot—
                 Quite a miniature affair—
                      Hung about with trellised vine,
            Furnish it upon the spot
                 With the treasures rich and rare
                      I've endeavoured to define.
            Live to love and love to live—
                 You will ripen at your ease,
                      Growing on the sunny side—
            Fate has nothing more to give.
                 You're a dainty man to please
                      If you are not satisfied.
            Ah! Take my counsel, happy man;
            Act upon it, if you can!

(Enter Chorus of Contadine, running in, led by Fiametta and
Vittoria.  They are met by all the Ex-Gondoliers, who welcome
them heartily.)

     SCENE—CHORUS OF GIRLS, QUARTET, DUET and CHORUS.

       Here we are, at the risk of our lives,
       From ever so far, and we've brought your wives—
       And to that end we've crossed the main,
       And don't intend to return again!

FIA.           Though obedience is strong,
                 Curiosity's stronger—
            We waited for long,
                 Till we couldn't wait longer.

VIT.           It's imprudent, we know,
                 But without your society
            Existence was slow,
                 And we wanted variety—

BOTH.     Existence was slow, and we wanted variety.

ALL.      So here we are, at the risk of our lives,
       From ever so far, and we've brought your wives—
       And to that end we've crossed the main,
       And don't intend to return again!

(Enter Gianetta and Tessa.  They rush to the arms of Marco and
Giuseppe.)

GIU.      Tessa!
TESS.          Giuseppe!      {All embrace.}
GIA.      Marco!
MAR.           Gianetta!

                    TESSA and GIANETTA.

TESS.          After sailing to this island—
GIA.                Tossing in a manner frightful,
TESS.          We are all once more on dry land—
GIA.                And we find the change delightful,
TESS.          As at home we've been remaining—
                 We've not seen you both for ages,
GIA.           Tell me, are you fond of reigning?—
                 How's the food, and what's the wages?
TESS.          Does your new employment please ye?—
GIA.                How does Royalizing strike you?
TESS.          Is it difficult or easy?—
GIA.                Do you think your subjects like you?
TESS.          I am anxious to elicit,
                 Is it plain and easy steering?
GIA.           Take it altogether, is it
                 Better fun than gondoliering?
BOTH.          We shall both go on requesting
                 Till you tell us, never doubt it;
            Everything is interesting,
                 Tell us, tell us all about it!

CHORUS.        They will both go on requesting, etc.

TESS.          Is the populace exacting?
GIA.                Do they keep you at a distance?
TESS.          All unaided are you acting,
GIA.                Or do they provide assistance?
TESS.          When you're busy, have you got to
                 Get up early in the morning?
GIA.           If you do what you ought not to,
                 Do they give the usual warning?
TESS.          With a horse do they equip you?
GIA.                Lots of trumpeting and drumming?
TESS.          Do the Royal tradesmen tip you?
GIA.                Ain't the livery becoming!
TESS.          Does your human being inner
                 Feed on everything that nice is?
GIA.           Do they give you wine for dinner;
                 Peaches, sugar-plums, and ices?
BOTH.          We shall both go on requesting
                 Till you tell us, never doubt it;
            Everything is interesting,
                 Tell us, tell us all about it!

CHORUS.        They will both go on requesting, etc.

  MAR.  This is indeed a most delightful surprise!
  TESS.  Yes, we thought you'd like it.  You see, it was like
this.  After you left we felt very dull and mopey, and the days
crawled by, and you never wrote; so at last I said to Gianetta,
"I can't stand this any longer; those two poor Monarchs haven't
got any one to mend their stockings or sew on their buttons or
patch their clothes—at least, I hope they haven't—let us all
pack up a change and go and see how they're getting on."  And she
said, "Done," and they all said, "Done"; and we asked old Giacopo
to lend us his boat, and he said, "Done"; and we've crossed the
sea, and, thank goodness, that's done; and here we are,
and—and—I've done!
  GIA.  And now—which of you is King?
  TESS.  And which of us is Queen?
  GIU.  That we shan't know until Nurse turns up.  But never
mind that—the question is, how shall we celebrate the
commencement of our honeymoon?  Gentlemen, will you allow us to
offer you a magnificent banquet?
  ALL.  We will!
  GIU.  Thanks very much; and, ladies, what do you say to a
dance?
  TESS.  A banquet and a dance!  O, it's too much happiness!

                     CHORUS and DANCE.

       Dance a cachucha, fandango, bolero,
       Xeres we'll drink—Manzanilla, Montero—
       Wine, when it runs in abundance, enhances
       The reckless delight of that wildest of dances!
            To the pretty pitter-pitter-patter,
            And the clitter-clitter-clitter-clatter—
                 Clitter—clitter—clatter,
                 Pitter—pitter—patter,
            Patter, patter, patter, patter, we'll dance.
       Old Xeres we'll drink—Manzanilla, Montero;
       For wine, when it runs in abundance, enhances
       The reckless delight of that wildest of dances!

(Cachucha.)

(The dance is interrupted by the unexpected appearance of Don
Alhambra, who looks on with astonishment.  Marco and Giuseppe
appear embarrassed.  The others run off, except Drummer Boy, who
is driven off by Don Alhambra.)

  DON AL.  Good evening.  Fancy ball?
  GIU.  No, not exactly.  A little friendly dance.  That's
all.  Sorry you're late.
  DON AL.  But I saw a groom dancing, and a footman!
  MAR.  Yes.  That's the Lord High Footman.
  DON AL.  And, dear me, a common little drummer boy!
  GIU.  Oh no!  That's the Lord High Drummer Boy.
  DON AL.  But surely, surely the servants'-hall is the place
for these gentry?
  GIU.  Oh dear no!  We have appropriated the servants'-hall.
It's the Royal Apartment, and accessible only by tickets
obtainable at the Lord Chamberlain's office.
  MAR.  We really must have some place that we can call our
own.
  DON AL. (puzzled).  I'm afraid I'm not quite equal to the
intellectual pressure of the conversation.
  GIU.  You see, the Monarchy has been re-modelled on
Republican principles.
  DON AL.  What!
  GIU.  All departments rank equally, and everybody is at the
head of his department.
  DON AL.  I see.
  MAR.  I'm afraid you're annoyed.
  DON AL.  No.  I won't say that.  It's not quite what I
expected.
  GIU.  I'm awfully sorry.
  MAR.  So am I.
  GIU.  By the by, can I offer you anything after your voyage?
A plate of macaroni and a rusk?
  DON AL. (preoccupied).  No, no—nothing—nothing.
  GIU.  Obliged to be careful?
  DON AL.  Yes—gout.  You see, in every Court there are
distinctions that must be observed.
  GIU. (puzzled).  There are, are there?
  DON AL.  Why, of course.  For instance, you wouldn't have a
Lord High Chancellor play leapfrog with his own cook.
  MAR.  Why not?
  DON AL.  Why not!  Because a Lord High Chancellor is a
personage of great dignity, who should never, under any
circumstances, place himself in the position of being told to
tuck in his tuppenny, except by noblemen of his own rank.  A Lord
High Archbishop, for instance, might tell a Lord High Chancellor
to tuck in his tuppenny, but certainly not a cook, gentlemen,
certainly not a cook.
  GIU.  Not even a Lord High Cook?
  DON AL.  My good friend, that is a rank that is not
recognized at the Lord Chamberlain's office.  No, no, it won't
do.  I'll give you an instance in which the experiment was tried.

       SONG—DON ALHAMBRA, with MARCO and GIUSEPPE.

DON AL.   There lived a King, as I've been told,
       In the wonder-working days of old,
       When hearts were twice as good as gold,
            And twenty times as mellow.
       Good-temper triumphed in his face,
       And in his heart he found a place
       For all the erring human race
            And every wretched fellow.
       When he had Rhenish wine to drink
       It made him very sad to think
       That some, at junket or at jink,
            Must be content with toddy.

MAR. and GIU.  With toddy, must be content with toddy.

DON AL.   He wished all men as rich as he
       (And he was rich as rich could be),
       So to the top of every tree
            Promoted everybody.

MAR. and GIU.  Now, that's the kind of King for me.
       He wished all men as rich as he,
       So to the top of every tree
            Promoted everybody!

DON AL.   Lord Chancellors were cheap as sprats,
       And Bishops in their shovel hats
       Were plentiful as tabby cats—
            In point of fact, too many.
       Ambassadors cropped up like hay,
       Prime Ministers and such as they
       Grew like asparagus in May,
            And Dukes were three a penny.
       On every side Field-Marshals gleamed,
       Small beer were Lords-Lieutenant deemed,
       With Admirals the ocean teemed
            All round his wide dominions.

MAR. and GIU.  With Admirals all round his wide dominions.

DON AL.   And Party Leaders you might meet
       In twos and threes in every street
       Maintaining, with no little heat,
            Their various opinions.

MAR. and GIU.  Now that's a sight you couldn't beat—
       Two Party Leaders in each street
       Maintaining, with no little heat,
            Their various opinions.

DON AL.   That King, although no one denies
       His heart was of abnormal size,
       Yet he'd have acted otherwise
            If he had been acuter.
       The end is easily foretold,
       When every blessed thing you hold
       Is made of silver, or of gold,
            You long for simple pewter.
       When you have nothing else to wear
       But cloth of gold and satins rare,
       For cloth of gold you cease to care—
            Up goes the price of shoddy.

MAR. and GIU.  Of shoddy, up goes the price of shoddy.

DON AL.   In short, whoever you may be,
       To this conclusion you'll agree,
       When every one is somebodee,
            Then no one's anybody!

MAR. and GIU.  Now that's as plain as plain can be,
       To this conclusion we agree—

ALL.      When every one is somebodee,
            Then no one's anybody!

(Gianetta and Tessa enter unobserved.  The two girls, impelled by
curiosity, remain listening at the back of the stage.)

  DON AL.  And now I have some important news to communicate.
His Grace the Duke of Plaza-Toro, Her Grace the Duchess, and
their beautiful daughter Casilda—I say their beautiful daughter
Casilda—
  GIU.  We heard you.
  DON AL.  Have arrived at Barataria, and may be here at any
moment.
  MAR.  The Duke and Duchess are nothing to us.
  DON AL.  But the daughter—the beautiful daughter!  Aha!
Oh, you're a lucky dog, one of you!
  GIU.  I think you're a very incomprehensible old gentleman.
  DON AL.  Not a bit—I'll explain.  Many years ago when you
(whichever you are) were a baby, you (whichever you are) were
married to a little girl who has grown up to be the most
beautiful young lady in Spain.  That beautiful young lady will be
here to claim you (whichever you are) in half an hour, and I
congratulate that one (whichever it is) with all my heart.
  MAR.  Married when a baby!
  GIU.  But we were married three months ago!
  DON AL.  One of you—only one.  The other (whichever it is)
is an unintentional bigamist.
  GIA. and TESS. (coming forward).  Well, upon my word!
  DON AL.  Eh?  Who are these young people?
  TESS.  Who are we?  Why, their wives, of course.  We've just
arrived.
  DON AL.  Their wives!  Oh dear, this is very unfortunate!
Oh dear, this complicates matters!  Dear, dear, what will Her
Majesty say?
  GIA.  And do you mean to say that one of these Monarchs was
already married?
  TESS.  And that neither of us will be a Queen?
  DON AL.  That is the idea I intended to convey.  (Tessa and
Gianetta begin to cry.)
  GIU. (to Tessa).  Tessa, my dear, dear child—
  TESS.  Get away! perhaps it's you!
  MAR. (to Gia.).  My poor, poor little woman!
  GIA.  Don't!  Who knows whose husband you are?
  TESS.  And pray, why didn't you tell us all about it before
they left Venice?
  DON AL.  Because, if I had, no earthly temptation would have
induced these gentlemen to leave two such extremely fascinating
and utterly irresistible little ladies!
  TESS.  There's something in that.
  DON AL.  I may mention that you will not be kept long in
suspense, as the old lady who nursed the Royal child is at
present in the torture chamber, waiting for me to interview her.
  GIU.  Poor old girl.  Hadn't you better go and put her out
of her suspense?
  DON AL.  Oh no—there's no hurry—she's all right.  She has
all the illustrated papers.  However, I'll go and interrogate
her, and, in the meantime, may I suggest the absolute propriety
of your regarding yourselves as single young ladies.  Good
evening!
                                                  (Exit Don
Alhambra.)
  GIA.  Well, here's a pleasant state of things!
  MAR.  Delightful.  One of us is married to two young ladies,
and nobody knows which; and the other is married to one young
lady whom nobody can identify!
  GIA.  And one of us is married to one of you, and the other
is married to nobody.
  TESS.  But which of you is married to which of us, and
what's to become of the other?  (About to cry.)
  GIU.  It's quite simple.  Observe.  Two husbands have
managed to acquire three wives.  Three wives—two husbands.
(Reckoning up.)  That's two-thirds of a husband to each wife.
  TESS.  O Mount Vesuvius, here we are in arithmetic!  My good
sir, one can't marry a vulgar fraction!
  GIU.  You've no right to call me a vulgar fraction.
  MAR.  We are getting rather mixed.  The situation is
entangled.  Let's try and comb it out.

        QUARTET—MARCO, GIUSEPPE, GIANETTA, TESSA.

            In a contemplative fashion,
                 And a tranquil frame of mind,
            Free from every kind of passion,
                 Some solution let us find.
            Let us grasp the situation,
                 Solve the complicated plot—
            Quiet, calm deliberation
                 Disentangles every knot.

TESS.I, no doubt, Giuseppe wedded—          THE OTHERS.    In a
contemplative
       That's, of course, a slice of luck           fashion,
etc.
  He is rather dunder-headed.
       Still distinctly, he's a duck.

GIA. I, a victim, too, of Cupid,             THE OTHERS.    Let
us grasp the
       Marco married - that is clear.               situation,
etc.
  He's particularly stupid,
       Still distinctly, he's a dear.

MAR. To Gianetta I was mated;           THE OTHERS.    In a
contemplative
       I can prove it in a trice:                   fashion,
etc.
  Though her charms are overrated,
       Still I own she's rather nice.

GIU. I to Tessa, willy-nilly,           THE OTHERS.    Let us
grasp the
       All at once a victim fell.                   situation,
etc.
  She is what is called a silly,
       Still she answers pretty well.

MAR.           Now when we were pretty babies
                 Some one married us, that's clear—

GIA.                     And if I can catch her
                      I'll pinch her and scratch her
                 And send her away with a flea in her ear.

GIU.           He whom that young lady married,
                 To receive her can't refuse.

TESS.                    If I overtake her
                      I'll warrant I'll make her
                 To shake in her aristocratical shoes!

GIA. (to Tess.).    If she married your Giuseppe
                 You and he will have to part—

TESS. (to Gia.).    If I have to do it
                 I'll warrant she'll rue it—
            I'll teach her to marry the man of my heart!

TESS. (to Gia.).    If she married Messer Marco
                 You're a spinster, that is plain—

GIA. (to Tess.).    No matter—no matter.
                 If I can get at her
            I doubt if her mother will know her again!

ALL.      Quiet, calm deliberation
            Disentangles every knot!

                                                  (Exeunt,
pondering.)

(March.  Enter procession of Retainers, heralding approach of
Duke, Duchess, and Casilda.  All three are now dressed with the
utmost magnificence.)
           CHORUS OF MEN, with DUKE and DUCHESS.

            With ducal pomp and ducal pride
                 (Announce these comers,
                 O ye kettle-drummers!)
            Comes Barataria's high-born bride.
                 (Ye sounding cymbals clang!)
            She comes to claim the Royal hand—
                 (Proclaim their Graces,
                 O ye double basses!)
            Of the King who rules this goodly land.
                 (Ye brazen brasses bang!)

DUKE and       This polite attention touches
DUCH.          Heart of Duke and heart of Duchess
                 Who resign their pet
                 With profound regret.
            She of beauty was a model
            When a tiny tiddle-toddle,
                 And at twenty-one
                 She's excelled by none!</p>
